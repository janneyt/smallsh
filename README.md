# smallsh
# smallsh
compile with these arguments: gcc -Wall smallsh.c -o smallsh

I had a fully working program. I know, it's got to be a common claim. In my case, I went to the TEACH website because I had a single error on the p3testscript that was directing input to output. I cleared the running files. Whether through my actions or those of whatever automatic processes are on the server, all of my source code files are now blank.

As proof, I've included the compiled file that still exists on os1.

Thank you for the opportunity for this interesting project.
